## Background of the Idea

The biggest concern faced while living alone is the problem of handling various ingredients purchased for cooking. Even if you want to cook, it's always difficult to utilize the remaining ingredients in the refrigerator effectively, resulting in making the same types of food. In such a situation, I thought it would be convenient to have an application that recommends recipes based on the entered ingredients.

## Primary Process

1. Launch the application
2. Enter the available ingredients
3. Receive recipe recommendations

## Key Features

1. **Basic Recipe Recommendation + Customized Recommendations:**
   - Recommends recipes that maximize the use of ingredients the user possesses while aligning with health conditions or diet goals.

2. **Food Bank Integration:**
   - Connects to the nearest Food Bank location based on the entered address, promoting a reduction in food waste and social responsibility.

## What is a Food Bank?

A Food Bank is a food-sharing system that practices love and sharing through the collection of surplus food, goods, funds, etc., generated in the process of production, distribution, sale, and consumption. Food Banks receive donations from individuals, food-related businesses, wholesalers, retailers, restaurants, etc., and distribute them to neighbors in need.
